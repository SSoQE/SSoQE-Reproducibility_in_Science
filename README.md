## Setup

### Getting the repo

The template is accessible in two ways:
  
1. If a user has a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), the easiest way is to create your own GitHub repo using this GitHub template. More details about how to use GitHub templates are on [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
2. Use can download the latest [Release](https://github.com/OndrejMottl/quarto_revealjs_template/releases) of the Workflow as a zip file.

### Set up R project

Once a user obtains their version of the project, there are several steps to be done before using it:

* Update [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) and [R-studio IDE](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/). There are many guides on how to do so (e.g. [here](https://jennhuck.github.io/workshops/install_update_R.html))
* Execute all individual steps with the `R/___Init_project___.R` script. This will result in the preparation of all R-packages using the [`{renv}` package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html), which is an R dependency management of your projects. Mainly it will install [`{RUtilpol}`](https://github.com/HOPE-UIB-BIO/R-Utilpol-package) and all dependencies. `{RUtilpol}` is used throughout the project as a version control of files.
* Set up your preferences by editing the The Config file in `R/00_Config_file.R` script. The Config file is a script where all settings (configurations) and criteria used throughout the project are predefined by the user before running individual scripts. In addition, it prepares the current session by loading the required packages and saving all settings throughout the project
